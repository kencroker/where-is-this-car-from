# where-is-this-car-from

I created an algorithm to predict whether a car is from the US, Japan, or Europe. The model doesn't know the name of the manufacturer or the model. It only knows the weight, horsepower, and a few other attributes of the car. The model then uses a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify a car as being from either the US, Japan, or Europe.
